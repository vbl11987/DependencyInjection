# DependencyInjection
Project created to demonstrate the different uses of dependency injection in an ASP.NET Core MVC applicaition

In the project I tried to uses the different ways to implemment dependency injection creating isolated coupled components that can be easily replaced
and easily isolated for testing, also how to use dependency injection into action method.
